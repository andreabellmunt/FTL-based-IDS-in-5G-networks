# Federated Transfer Learning-based Intrusion Detection System in 5G networks

This project focuses on the development of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) within 5G, and more specifically IoT, networks. The main idea is to implement a Federated Learning (FL) framework that allows to train a global detection model without the need to share data between all devices, consequently ensuring their privacy. The UNSW-NB15 dataset is used for training purposes, using subsets as local datasets. Then,
